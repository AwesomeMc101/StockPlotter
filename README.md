# StockPlotter
Little visualizer I wrote to look at relationships between stock prices and various indicators.

Allows you to plot multiple indicators and save images of said plots.
Very basic!

## I'm not a C# expert lol. Please mind the horrible code- I just wanted to try something.


### Requires a valid AlphaVantage.co api key. (Can be free!)
